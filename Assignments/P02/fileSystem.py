# This FileSystem class represents a file system,

    # GetFileID Description:
    # The `__getFileId` method is for obtaining the file or folder ID based on a provided path
    # relative to the current working directory.
    # 1.`path (str)`: The path for which you want to determine the corresponding file or folder ID.
    # The method begins with the current working directory ID (`self.cwdid`) and iterates
    # through the path components. It handles relative paths (e.g., `./` and `..`)
    # and searches for matching file or folder entries in the "files_data" table within
    # the database. If a match is found, it updates the current path ID accordingly.
    # If the provided path leads to a file or folder, it returns the corresponding ID.
    # If not found or an error occurs, it returns `None`.
    # This method is crucial for navigating and identifying files and folders within the database structure.
