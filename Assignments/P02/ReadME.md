#### Overview:
This is a project written in python that implements a Virtual FileSystem.
This project will implement a virtual database that uses Sqlite as its storage. We will not be storing files that huge, or storing thousands of them, so we should be fine. If there ever is an issue, it's not hard to change to PostGres or similar. This virtual file system will store all content in a single table like you see below. Our table will contain columns that represent the properties commonly found in a Linux long listing (e.g., ls -l). 

#### Instructions
