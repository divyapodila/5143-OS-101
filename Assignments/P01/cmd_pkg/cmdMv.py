This function first checks if the length of the params more than 1. If it is, again it checks if the source path provided is directory,if it is a directory then it copies all the content to the destination param using copytree() and the moved file is deleted from source using rmtree().

if the given source param is file then it just moves the contents to destination using move().

lastly if only param is provided,it raises an exception

-> copytree() method from shutil recursively copies an entire directory tree from source to the destination.

-> rmtree() method on the otherhand deletes an entire directory and it's contents.


-> shutil.move() method Recursively moves a file or directory to another location and returns the destination. If the destination directory already exists then src is moved inside that directory. If the destination already exists but is not a directory then it may be overwritten.
